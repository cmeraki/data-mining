# YouTube Audio and Transcript Downloader

This Python project downloads audio and transcript files from YouTube channels. The script uses `yt-dlp` to fetch audio files in WAV format and transcripts (subtitles) from specified YouTube URLs, saving them to designated folders. The script logs the download progress and errors for easy debugging.

## Features

- **Download Audio**: Extracts audio from YouTube videos and saves it in WAV format.
- **Download Transcripts**: Fetches transcripts (subtitles) in a specified language.
- **Logging**: Provides detailed logging of download progress and errors.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python package installed:

- `yt-dlp` (for downloading YouTube content)

You can install the required package using pip:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python download.py <channel_url> <audio_output_folder> <subtitle_output_folder>
```

- `<channel_url>`: URL of the YouTube channel from which to download content.
- `<audio_output_folder>`: Directory where audio files will be saved.
- `<subtitle_output_folder>`: Directory where subtitle files will be saved.

## Example

```bash
python download.py https://www.youtube.com/c/YourChannel ./audio ./subtitles
```

This command will download audio and subtitles from all videos on the specified YouTube channel and save them in the `./audio` and `./subtitles` directories, respectively.
